                         <h2>Springfield, Mo</h2>
                         <p>I spent the first 28 years of my life living in Springfield, Mo. I always wanted to live somewhere else, but didn't have the courage to do it alone.</p>

                         <h2>London, UK</h2>
                         <p>In 2006 I moved to London, UK. The first 6 months were a little difficult to acclimate. Once I learned my way around and made great life long friends I loved it and never wanted to move back to the States. Visiting a few times a year was enough at that point. </p>

                         <h2>Harlingen, Tx</h2>
                         <p>After 3 wonderful years in London, I was not able to renew my work visa to stay. Although I love my family and friends in Springfield I still wanted to travel. So I decided to do traveling therapy and applied fo my Physical Therapy licence in Texas. It only took an few weeks and I was on my way to South Texas.</p>

                         <h2>Houston, Tx</h2>
                         <p>So my 13 week contract in Harlingen Tx turned into 6 years and 1 handsome son Ian. When my son was 2, we needed a change and moved to Houston, Tx. The traffic is horrific, but we enjoyed our bubble around the Rice University area we lived in.</p>
